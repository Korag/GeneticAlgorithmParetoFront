# GeneticAlgorithmParetoFront

The program solves the two-criteria problem by solving two functions while limiting the domain of solutions. The search for a solution is carried out through a genetic algorithm, which as a result generates Pareto Front.

We define the following steps of the designed application:

1. Setting up the function formulas and domain limitations
2. Tuning the genetic algorithm
3. During the operation of the proper evolutionary algorithm, the user interface is refreshed in each iteration and it displays: a domain, a fluctuation graph of the values obtained and Pareto Front in the form of diagrams
4. The algorithm ends its operation when the limit iteration (defined by the user) is reached
